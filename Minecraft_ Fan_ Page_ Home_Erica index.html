         What is Minecraft?
       </h3>
       <p>
         Minecraft is a sandbox video game that allows players to explore, build, and survive in a pixelated, block-based world. With no set objectives, players have the freedom to shape their own adventuresâ€”whether it's crafting tools, mining deep underground, constructing massive structures, or battling dangerous mobs. The game features multiple modes including Survival, Creative, Adventure, and Hardcore, each offering a unique experience. Its endless possibilities, frequent updates, and active community have made Minecraft one of the best-selling and most influential games in history, inspiring millions to create, explore, and collaborate.
